It's pretty well known already that Trump uses an Android phone compared to his staff. This fact allows us to compare tweets directly
from Trump and tweets from his staff. Trump has a much more simplified lexicon compared to his staff. draintheswamp mainly came from Trump's
staff and not from him directly. Trump mainly used the word great compared to his staff who mainly tweeted great.
