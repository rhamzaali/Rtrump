It's pretty well known already that Trump uses an Android phone compared to his staff. This fact allows us to compare tweets directly
from Trump and tweets from his staff. Trump has a much more simplified lexicon compared to his staff which can easily be seen by the two word clouds. It's a pretty interesting notion that DrainTheSwamp came from his staff and not directly from him. This suggest that he piggy backed this phrase from his staff.
