The goal of the project is to take a hard look at trump. this is mainly
accomplished through studying any outgoing sources from Trump. The more
obvious source would be his twitter but a transcript or news article could be
of interest as well. We are mainly using R to analyze this data, but we may
use other languages such as python to translate and modify any sources we are
looking at.

>R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.


Any code we use for this project will be available through the RTrump [github](https://github.com/rhamzaali/Rtrump) page. Feel free to drop us
an [issue](https://github.com/rhamzaali/Rtrump/issues) if you want us to look at something specific in terms of the Trump.
